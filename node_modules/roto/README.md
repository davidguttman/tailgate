## Roto ##

Roto is a client-side router. It's basically Director.js (included) with some additional features.

Example usage:

    router = require 'roto'

    routingTable =
      '/': ->
        @target.html 'This is the root url.'
      
      '/systems': ->
        @target.html "This is another path, it is: #{@path}"
      
      '/parent':
        '/sub/:json': ->
          @target.html "This path takes json params, they are: #{JSON.stringify @params}"

    $(document).ready ->
      router $('body'), routingTable
